üß† LEARNING LOG
üì¶ localStorage
A built-in browser feature for storing data that can be used across multiple pages.

Used for storing small sets of data (up to 5MB) on the user's device when there's no server.

Example: I stored the .itineraryPlaceName elements retrieved from the itinerary web pages in localStorage, to be retrieved for use in the list on the "Plan Your Visit" page.

üîÅ JSON.stringify() & JSON.parse()
These two functions work as a pair:

JSON.stringify() ‚Äì turns the elements inside into a string.

JSON.parse() ‚Äì turns stringified data back into an array/original format/readable JavaScript code.

Example:
I used JSON.stringify(placeNameLocalStorage) to turn the array into a string, as localStorage can only store strings.

localStorage.setItem("placeNameLSKey", JSON.stringify(placeNameLocalStorage))
This stores the stringified array under the key "placeNameLSKey", which can later be retrieved with getItem().

Later, I retrieved it using:

JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("placeNameLSKey"))

‚úÇÔ∏è .trim()
Removes any whitespace from the beginning or end of a string.

[...day1Cells, ...day2Cells] - spread operator
Takes all the elements from the two arrays (or array-like) and combines into a new array. 

# ternary condation ? "":""#
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
isChecked ? "blue" : "";
## Map feature (planvisit.html) using Leaflet ##

I used Leaflet to create the map of Paris for the "Plan your Visit Page".
The intro guide on this page was very accessible, and guides through:
- adding the stylesheet link to the head of the html document.
- adding the script link to the bottom of the body of the html document. *N.B. This should come before any other script tags*
- adding the <div id="map"> to the html body. 

I acquired Paris coordinates from ChatGPT (this can also be done using Google Maps):
const* map = L.map("map").setView([48.853, 2.35], 13); 
**var is specified in the guidance but const is more up-to-date and compatible with Leaflet.*
Here, L represents a Leaflet method, specifically L.map creates the map. 
.setView([lat,long], zoom level) - sets the coordinates and the zoom level. 
The final part of initial setup:
L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    maxZoom: 19,
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>'
}).addTo(map);
L.tileLayer: instructs to retreive the map image/tile from the URL specified (OpenStreetMap), with z,x,y as placeholders for the zoom, lat and long which are auto-filled with what we specified previously. 
addTo(map): adds the tile layer to the map. 

üí¨ Code I worked on but didn‚Äôt include
Although I eventually got it to generate the list, it only worked if I navigated specifically from one of the itinerary pages to the Plan Your Visit page. I wanted that list to appear all the time, regardless of how the user arrived there.

It probably would‚Äôve worked fine if the user went through the website systematically (e.g. reading the itinerary pages first, then going to curate their own visit), but that couldn‚Äôt be guaranteed. I didn‚Äôt want the Plan Your Visit page to end up blank or show a default message if someone skipped steps.

‚úÖ Why I‚Äôm including it here
This code has been included below for reflection and future reference ‚Äî and because I learned a lot from it!

üß™ Code
js
Copy
Edit
// 1. Store the place names from itinerary pages into localStorage so they can be used on "Plan Your Visit" page
window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const path = window.location.pathname;

  if (
    path.includes("classic.html") ||
    path.includes("romantic.html") ||
    path.includes("hiddengems.html")
  ) {
    const itineraryPlaces = document.querySelectorAll(".itineraryPlaceName");

    if (itineraryPlaces.length > 0) {
      const placeNamesLocalStorage = [];
      itineraryPlaces.forEach((element) => {
        placeNamesLocalStorage.push(element.innerText.trim());
      });

      localStorage.setItem("placeNameLSKey", JSON.stringify(placeNamesLocalStorage));
      console.log(localStorage.getItem("placeNameLSKey"));
    }
  }

  if (path.includes("planvisit.html")) {
    const planVisitList = document.getElementById("favactivitieslist");

    if (!planVisitList) {
      console.warn("No plan visit list found on planvisit.html.");
      return;
    }

    const retrievedArray = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("placeNameLSKey"));

    if (!retrievedArray || retrievedArray.length === 0) {
      console.error("No place names found in local storage.");
      return;
    }

    retrievedArray.forEach((placeName) => {
      let newListItem = document.createElement("li");
      newListItem.innerText = placeName;
      planVisitList.appendChild(newListItem);
    });
  }
});
